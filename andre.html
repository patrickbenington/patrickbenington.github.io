<h3>Respiratory system & Muscular System</h3>
        <h5>The respiratory system in the human body controls the breathing and the oxygen intake that helps supply oxygen throughout the entire body and keeps it running. The oxygen that is being taken in through the body every minute represents the raw materials and the items needed to create the important items that everyday Americans used. It is taken in by the United States from other countries and the US itself (breathed in through the nose and mouth) and it enters the system. Then, the oxygen travels through the trachea and the airways to the lungs which represent the routes and transportation of the materials to the big companies and factories such as Carnegie Steel to get processed and created. After the oxygen goes through the lungs, it heads into the bloodstream (the constant motion of the railroads) where it is distributed throughout the entire body exactly how the railroads back then transported all the completed items and necessities throughout the United States. Without the bloodstream, oxygen would not be able to go through the system and the systems in the body would fail similar to how the people needing the items that are created by the big companies would suffer and eventually start falling apart. The oxygen of the respiratory system supplies everything including the important muscular system. The muscular system consists of three types of muscles. Cardiac muscles, smooth muscles, and skeletal muscles. The involuntary muscles which are the smooth ones, constantly run and never stop even when the brain does not tell the muscles to move. These muscles will stop working when oxygen stops going to the muscles and they fall apart. These represent the entire system and economy. Without the oxygen (raw materials and supplies), these involuntary muscles stop working and the economy falls apart very quickly and collapses completely. The skeletal muscles are the muscles that move when the body tells them to move. These can be represented by the services the massive amount of supplies the Robber Barons and the Captains of Industry owned. These billionaires had so much power and wealth, they had the choice to entirely control the flow of the system. Take John D. Rockefeller for example, he had so much wealth and money, he could decide when the railroads could move when they could stop. The cardiac muscles are the ones that are also involuntary and control the flow of blood and constantly keep going. They represent the flow of materials.

    There are three types of muscles. Smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscles. Smooth muscles (which are involuntary) can represent the system at the time, the skeletal system could be represented by the goods and services that were created or owned by the robber barons or the captains of industry because they could decide the entire system or route of the services similar to how the brain could control how the skeletal system works. The cardiac muscle is simply the railroad that ships supplies into and out and has multiple ventricles (represented as sections of work) that are sent out as well.
