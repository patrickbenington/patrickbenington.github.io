        <h5>Digestive System: Muckrakers
            The digestive system, which breaks down solids and gives good nutrients to the body, and gets rid of waste, is similar to Muckrakers, because both try to give the whole that they represent good things, and expose and get rid of bad and unnecessary things. Muckrakers were trying to expose all of the bad things that companies and the government were doing bad, and showing that to the public. 
            The stomach is the main source of this nutrient giving, waste disposing method, which represents the muckraker's main purpose, where they actually make it into a news source. 
            The mouth represents these muckrakers investigating certain large industries and gathering information, breaking it down into what they are doing wrong, and how they need to fix it, much like how the mouth gathers food and breaks it down into a usable resource. 
            The throat/esophagus represent how the muckrakers took the information from the businesses, and started to make it useful for information to go to the public
            The small and large intestines are like paperboys, who would deliver the news made by muckrakers, and deliver the news to the public
