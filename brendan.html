<h3>Nervous system & skeletal system</h3>
        <h5> The nervous system, the movement and balance of the body keeps you active and moving well along with the five senses we use to know the world around us. The Captains of Industry, which helps the country moving and on its feet, gives people jobs for what to do and sensing the art of the deal and balancing the country with it’s vast capital, this is the nervous system of the 1920's United States. They controlled the economy and mainstream business of the country, they’re advancement in fields all across the board were great and moved the country forward more efficiently than ever before. They were often philanthropists and used their wealth to boost the economy, create jobs, and increase productivity. Their wealth was much greater than billionaires of today and their power was unmeasurable, but this wasn't necessarily bad. They orchestrated what is often thought as the second industrial revolution, and because of this they encouraged the inventions of many modern machines that advanced the productivity of the country even more. Among these inventions were the typewriter, cash register, and the famous light bulb. But it wasn’t all good, there was immense wealth in such a small population of the country, industry was still newer at the time and there was less regulation and the billionaires' ways were often unethical and unfair. They underpaid their workers and didn’t care if they worked in unsafe environments, this is also where their robber baron nickname came from. Not only this but they also outright eliminated the middle class and it was just them, the poor, and the poor of the poor. Nonetheless they still helped the economy move and sensed what their country wanted and needed just like the nervous system, they could sense what would be successful and made it a money maker and more productivity for the country.

<h5>The skeletal system is the structure of the human and it’s solid core, it keeps the body standing strong and tall. The vertical city originated in America and helped it grow. They were the first to do it and cities like New York and Chicago trived off it. We made it a dominant force in our economy and country, they stood tall and strong for one simple reason. This reason came from a simple metal that had recently been discovered, steel, made up of iron and carbon among others, it became the most vital part of the vertical city and remains the most important engineering material on earth. It was tough enough to hold the huge towers that soared for the first time ever and America began building them. They popped up in the largest cities of the country quicker than you could blink and they quickly became part of mainstream business and life altogether. But like many things at the time, because it advanced so quickly there was little regulation about the buildings at the time. There were no laws saying there had to be fire escapes or hoses and the buildings were built so quickly they were often not safe. These things lead to disasters such as the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire where dozens were killed. But soon after people began to hear and listen and regulations were put into place and this led to things like unions but that’s for the topic of other systems. All and all though the vertical cities were a sound part of America and the scientific breakthrough of steel not only changed cities but many other things like machines and other common metal devices. They were strong, tall, and, tough just like the bones in our body that keep us together.
