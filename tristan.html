<h3>Immune system and Circulatory system</h3>
        <h5>The job of the immune system is to protect the body and it's cells. It does this by utilizing white blood cells or leukocytes. There are billions of cells that relate to the immune system in the body. First, cells called phagocytes detect bacteria and consume them to identify what they are through the use of antigens. Then they signal the T cells or the fighter cells to come in and start killing infected cells and what micro has invaded the body. Finally the b cells produce more antigens which is what grants immunity. The antigens will stick onto any microbe that has been prevsesaly identified. During the time of the gilded age many anti monopoly laws and a slew of trust buster presidents came along to protect smaller businesses. The reporters acted like the phagocytes and detected the problems with monopolies and trusts and began calling for the T cells or the government to remove monopoly holds on certain markets protecting the small business owners from the larger corporations that threaten their lives.

    Cardiovascular system: There are 11 import parts of the heart that play a key role in pumping blood to the body. The Superior and inferior vena cava serve as an intake for unoxygenated blood. The superior vena cava takes blood from the brain and the inferior everywhere else. Blood accumulates into the right atrium. Next the blood goes through the tricuspid valve and into the Right ventricle. connected to the Right ventricle is the pulmonary artery which carries the blood into the lungs which allows them to be oxygenated. After this it goes to pulmonary veins into the Left Atrium. The Blood in the left side goes through a similar process as the Right side however the valves are different. Finally the blood is taken to the Aorta and into the rest of the blood through the veins and arteries. The cardiovascular system ties into the railroad system as they are very similar. Bothâ€™s job is to distribute goods to different parts. As they do this they unload their materials and go back for resupply. The railroads in the gilded age played a vital role in the production of goods and, in transportation. At the time many large trust managers and business men controlled the railroads just as how the circulatory system is controlled by the heart and the brain. Finally the supplies that were being shipped kept the American economy going. Without them no trade and no production could continue. Just like how the blood keeps all of the cells living.
