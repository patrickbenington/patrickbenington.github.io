<h3>Immune system and Circulatory system</h3>
        <h5>The job of the immune system is to protect the body and it's cells. It does this by utilizing white blood cells or leukocytes. There are billions of cells that relate to the immune system in the body. First, cells called phagocytes detect bacteria and consume them to identify what they are through the use of antigens. Then they signal the T cells or the fighter cells to come in and start killing infected cells and what micro has invaded the body. Finally the b cells produce more antigens which is what grants immunity. The antigens will stick onto any microbe that has been prevsesaly identified. During the time of the gilded age many anti monopoly laws and a slew of trust buster presidents came along to protect smaller businesses. The reporters acted like the phagocytes and detected the problems with monopolies and trusts and began calling for the T cells or the government to remove monopoly holds on certain markets protecting the small business owners from the larger corporations that threaten their lives.

    Cardiovascular system: There are 11 import parts of the heart that play a key role in pumping blood to the body. The Superior and inferior vena cava serve as an intake for unoxygenated blood. The superior vena cava takes blood from the brain and the inferior everywhere else. Blood accumulates into the right atrium. Next the blood goes into the Right
